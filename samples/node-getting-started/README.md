# Getting Started with Node.js

This tutorial will show you how to develop and debug a Node.js Sample App with Okteto.

## Step 1: Deploy the Node.js Sample App

The `k8s.yml` file at the root of this folder contains the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Node.js Sample App.
Run the application by executing:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f k8s.yml
```

```
deployment.apps "hello-world" created
service "hello-world" created
```

## Step 2: Activate your development container

The [dev](reference/manifest.mdx#dev-object-optional) section defines how to activate a development container for the Node.js Sample App:

```
dev:
  hello-world:
    command: bash
    sync:
      - .:/usr/src/app
    forward:
      - 3000:3000
      - 9229:9229
```

The `hello-world` key matches the name of the hello world Deployment. The meaning of the rest of fields is:
- `command`: the start command of the development container
- `sync`: the folders that will be synchronized between your local machine and the development container
- `forward`: a list of ports to forward from your development container to localhost in your machine. This is needed to access your application on localhost and to configure the Node.js debugger

Also, note that there is a `.stignore` file to indicate which files shouldn't be synchronized to your development container.
This is useful to avoid synchronizing binaries, build artifacts, git metadata, or dependencies like the `node_modules` folder.

Next, execute the following command to activate your development container:

```console
$ okteto up
```

```console
 âœ“  Persistent volume successfully attached
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      hello-world
    Forward:   3000 -> 3000
               9229 -> 9229


Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:hello-world app>
```

Working in your development container is the same as working on your local machine.
Start the application in hot-reload mode by running the following command:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> npm run start
```

```console
> node-getting-started@1.0.0 start /usr/src/app
> nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 2.0.18
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Starting hello-world server...
```

Test your application by running the following command:

```console
curl localhost:3000
```

```console
Hello world!
```

## Step 3: Develop directly on Kubernetes

Open the `index.js` file in your favorite local IDE and modify the response message on line 5 to be *Hello world from Kubernetes!*. Save your changes.

```javascript
  res.send('Hello world from Kubernetes!');
```

Okteto will synchronize your changes to your development container on Kubernetes.
Take a look at the development container shell and notice how the changes are detected by `nodemon` and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Starting hello-world server...
```

Test your application by running the following command:

```console
curl localhost:3000
```

```console
Hello world from Kubernetes!
```

Your code changes were instantly applied. No commit, build, or push required ðŸ˜Ž!

## Step 4: Debug directly on Kubernetes

Okteto enables you to debug your applications directly from your favorite IDE.
Let's take a look at how that works in VS Code, one of the most popular IDEs for Node development.
If you haven't done it yet, install the Node.js extension available from Visual Studio marketplace.

Cancel the execution of `nodemon index.js` from the development container shell by pressing `ctrl + c`.
Rerun your application in debug mode:

```console
cindy:hello-world app> npm run debug
```

```console
Debugger listening on ws://0.0.0.0:9229/73d8d793-b0c3-4310-86ee-3a42938a5df1
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
```

Open the _Debug_ extension and run the *Connect to okteto* debug configuration (or press the F5 shortcut):

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Connect to okteto",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "address": "localhost",
            "port": 9229,
            "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "remoteRoot": "/usr/src/app",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```

> You should be replacing the value of `remoteRoot` with wherever your application code is.

Add a breakpoint on `index.js`, line 5. Go back to the browser and reload the page.
The execution will halt at your breakpoint. You can then inspect the request, the available variables, etc...

Your code is running on Kubernetes, but you can debug it from your local machine without any extra services or tools.
Pretty cool no? ðŸ˜‰
